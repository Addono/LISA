# TinySDF

TinySDF is a tiny and fast JavaScript library for generating SDF (signed distance field)
from system fonts on the browser using Canvas 2D and
[Felzenszwalb/Huttenlocher distance transform](https://cs.brown.edu/~pff/dt/).
This is very useful for [rendering text with WebGL](https://www.mapbox.com/blog/text-signed-distance-fields/).
