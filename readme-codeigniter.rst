Just deal with it.

************
Requirements
************

The server should be able to run CodeIgniter with support for a database.

Therefore a PHP version 5.6 or newer is recommended.

It should work on 5.3.7 as well, but we strongly advise you NOT to run such old versions of PHP, because of potential security and performance issues, as well as missing features.

************
Installation
************

Go to application/config/ and rename database.php-setup to database.php, then update it with your database account settings. In the same folder there is a config.php file, update this with your domain name.

Afterwards visit http(s)://$yoururl$/index.php/install.
